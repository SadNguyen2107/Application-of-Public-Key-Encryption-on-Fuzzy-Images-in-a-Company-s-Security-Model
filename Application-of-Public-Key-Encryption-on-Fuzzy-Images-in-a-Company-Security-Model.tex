\abstract{
    This report presents an approach to addressing the implementation of a
    security model in companies by using picture fuzzy public key encryption, with a more
    detailed focus on utilizing user biometric data as a secret key. Since biometric data is
    blurred or noisy and changes with each collection, traditional public key encryption
    models cannot be used; instead, a picture fuzzy public key encryption model must be
    employed. This study introduces the concept of picture fuzzy public key encryption
    (PFPKE), a public encryption model that accepts a portion of blurred data (a noisy version
    of the original biometric data) as a private key for decrypting the ciphertext. Unlike
    traditional public key encryption models, where the private key is typically stored on
    devices (e.g., on USB drives), the picture fuzzy public key encryption model does not
    require any device to store the private key
